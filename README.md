# RSA2017-App

This is a prototype of the app I am developing for use in the field for regeneration surveyors. It performs a few calculations to aid a surveyor when determining minimum height requirements for acceptable stocking in Establishment surveys, required number of detailed plots and performs age calculations for Performance Surveys. 

There isn't a whole lot of Front End work on this version, since I am currently rewriting the functionality of the app itself. In the next version there will be better CSS styling, icons and animations.
